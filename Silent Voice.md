ü§ü Silent Voice ‚Äì Sign Language Translator
Silent Voice is an AI-based application designed to identify American Sign Language (ASL) gestures and convert them into both text and speech. The project aims to bridge the communication gap between the deaf/mute community and the hearing population by providing real-time gesture recognition using computer vision and machine learning.

üìñ About the Project
Objective
To develop an application that recognizes ASL signs and converts them into readable text and audible speech to assist individuals with hearing or speech impairments in real-time communication.

Data Source
Utilizes publicly available ASL gesture datasets (e.g., ASL Alphabet from Kaggle) for model training.

Missing Value Handling
Not applicable to gesture images, but preprocessing includes image resizing, normalization, and cleaning of corrupt data.

Feature Encoding
Images are converted to pixel matrices and fed into the model. Labels are encoded using one-hot encoding or numerical encoding based on the model used.

Outlier Detection
Not applied in the traditional sense but model validation ensures removal of misclassified or noisy samples.

Outlier Handling
Augmented data techniques and training on clean subsets are used to minimize the impact of noise or misclassified samples.

Data Visualization
Uses Matplotlib and OpenCV to display real-time hand gesture capture, classification results, and bounding boxes.

Feature Selection
Uses image data (pixels) as input features. No manual feature selection; convolutional filters are applied automatically in deep learning models.

Model Training
Trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model (or other ML models) on the ASL dataset. Validation data is used to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.

Model Evaluation
Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and real-time gesture prediction tests using webcam input.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Pandas ‚Äì For data manipulation (optional, if using tabular data).

NumPy ‚Äì For numerical operations.

OpenCV ‚Äì For real-time video capture and hand tracking.

TensorFlow / PyTorch ‚Äì For building and training the gesture recognition model.

Matplotlib ‚Äì For visualization and debugging.

Tkinter ‚Äì For building the GUI interface.

pyttsx3 / gTTS ‚Äì For converting recognized text to speech.

Install dependencies using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib tensorflow pyttsx3
‚úÖ Result
The application recognizes ASL hand signs and provides the following outputs:

Live Text Display: Shows the predicted sign as text.

Real-time Feedback: Display captured hand with bounding box and label.
